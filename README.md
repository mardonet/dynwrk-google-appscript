Utilities for people running a business in Google Workspace

I have a company that export software services to US from Chile, so this is very niche.

Indicators like UTM, UF and so on can be found in [Previred](https://www.previred.com/indicadores-previsionales), [Banco Central](https://si3.bcentral.cl/indicadoressiete/secure/indicadoresdiarios.aspx) or plain old [Google](www.google.cl).
